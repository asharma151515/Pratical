# CP1404 Practical Reflection - Asmita Sharma

Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following.  
Replace each `...` with your meaningful answer.

## What have you changed about your process in this subject based on your personal reflection?

...I have started to adopt a more structured approach to tackling coding assignments. 
Instead of diving straight into coding, I now spend time understanding the requirements
and planning out the logic on paper first. This has helped me clarify my thoughts and 
break down the tasks into manageable pieces.

## What do you still need to change in terms of your approach, application, time on task, attitude, etc.?

...I need to work on managing my time better and setting specific milestones for each coding task. 
I tend to underestimate the time required, which leads to rushed work. 
also, I want to shift my mindset to view challenges as opportunities to learn, 
rather than as obstacles, so I can be more resilient when I encounter difficulties.

## What are you doing well in the subject so far that you will keep doing?

...I have been diligent about completing the readings and tutorials leading up to each practical. 
This preparation helps me feel more confident going into each coding session. 
I will continue to do this because it reinforces my understanding and provides a foundation for the practical work.

## What do you need to stop or change in your work for this subject overall so far?

...I need to stop relying heavily on referrals from classmates for solutions without trying to solve the problems
on my own first. While itâ€™s helpful to seek help, I realize that I often overlook the importance of struggling
with the problem independently, as this is where most of the learning happens.

## What is one request you have or change you suggest for this subject and/or your IT degree overall?

...I would appreciate having more group-oriented coding exercises where I can collaborate on projects.
This would not only help me learn from others but also build my confidence in coding by discussing approaches 
and solutions as a team. Along, having more access to peer-led study sessions could enhance learning 
for students like me who find some concepts challenging.
