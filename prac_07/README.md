Based on the guidelines and expectations from the PDF, here's a sample README file that a student might create for their project. The formatting makes use of 
Markdown syntax, and it includes all necessary sections as called out in the instructions.

1. Project Management System

## Description
This project is a simple Project Management System developed as part of the CP1404 Practicals curriculum. The application allows users to manage projects by 
adding, updating, displaying, filtering, and saving project data efficiently. It showcases the principles of clean code, object-oriented programming, and file 
handling in Python.
