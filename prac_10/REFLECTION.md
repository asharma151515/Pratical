# CP1404 Practical Reflection

Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following.  
Replace each `...` with your meaningful answer.

## Estimates

### Regarding the **estimates** that you did for practical tasks...
... I regularly spent around 3 hours on each practical. I used Git every day, which helped me track changes and 
improve my work more effectively. Using version control made it easier to make modifications and manage my code.

### How was your estimate accuracy usually?

... Not very accurate at first — I often guessed too medium.

### How did your estimate accuracy improve or change during the course of the subject?

... It got better as I understood the tasks more.

### What did you learn from doing these estimates?

... Estimating helped me plan my time and stay on track.

## Code Reviews

### What have you learned from being reviewed by other people?

... They noticed things I missed, like better naming or cleaner code.

### What have you learned from doing code reviews of other people?

... I learned new ways to write code and spot mistakes.

Provide proper Markdown links (not bare URLs) to two (2) PRs that show you doing good code reviews for any of the past
pracs.  
For each one, write a short explanation of what was good about your review.

### Good Code Review 2

### Explanation
... I provided comprehensive feedback that helped the author identify areas where their logic could be optimized. 
I pointed out specific instances of redundant code and suggested best practices for function naming conventions, which improved 
the overall readability of their code.


## Practicals

### Regarding the **practical tasks** overall, what would you change if you were in charge of the subject?

... If I were in charge, I'd focus on a few things. First, more variety in the types of 
tasks would be great – maybe some group projects or more open-ended challenges. Second, 
more direct links between the practical tasks and the theory we learned in lectures would
help. And finally, more opportunities for feedback throughout the process, not just at the
end, would be really beneficial for learning.

### What did you do really well for practicals in this subject?

... I think I did well on the data analysis practical. I was able to clean and analyze
the data effectively, and my report was well-written and easy to understand. I also
worked well with my partner on the group project
